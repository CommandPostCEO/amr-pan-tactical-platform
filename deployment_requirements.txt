# AMR PAN TACTICAL INTELLIGENCE PLATFORM
# EMERGENCY MINIMAL REQUIREMENTS - GUARANTEED STREAMLIT CLOUD COMPATIBILITY

# Core Platform (Absolutely Required)
streamlit>=1.28.0
pandas>=1.5.0
numpy>=1.20.0

# Excel Processing (Essential for AMR data)
openpyxl>=3.0.0

# Date/Time Utilities (Built-in support)
# No additional requirements - using datetime from stdlib

# EMERGENCY DEPLOYMENT NOTES:
# - Removed all Plotly dependencies (causing deployment failures)
# - Using Streamlit native charts instead
# - Minimal dependency footprint for maximum compatibility
# - All core tactical functionality preserved
# - Charts will use st.bar_chart() and st.line_chart()

# PHASE 3A TARGET: GET PLATFORM OPERATIONAL IMMEDIATELY
# PHASE 3B ENHANCEMENT: Add advanced visualization once platform is stable
